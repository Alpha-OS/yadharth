# QR Code Generation & Download Plan

This document outlines an exhaustive, step-by-step plan for implementing bulk QR code generation for all participants in an event, zipping the QR codes, and providing a download to the user.

---

## Steps

- [ ] **Design the QR Code Generation Feature**
  - [ ] Define the user flow for triggering QR code generation (e.g., button in event dashboard).
  - [ ] Specify the URL format for each participant's certificate (e.g., `https://www.mydomain.xyz/{customer_id}/{event_id}/{participant_id}`).

- [ ] **Set Up Required Libraries**
  - [ ] Add a QR code generation library (e.g., `qrcode`).
  - [ ] Add a ZIP file creation library (e.g., `jszip`).

- [ ] **Create Server Action or API Route**
  - [ ] Implement a server action or API route (e.g., `/api/generate-qrcodes`).
  - [ ] Ensure authentication and authorization for the request.

- [ ] **Fetch Event Participants**
  - [ ] Retrieve all participants for the selected event from the database.
  - [ ] Validate that the event belongs to the authenticated customer.

- [ ] **Generate Unique URLs for Each Participant**
  - [ ] For each participant, construct the unique certificate URL using the specified format.

- [ ] **Generate QR Codes**
  - [ ] For each participant, generate a QR code image (PNG or SVG) for their unique URL.
  - [ ] Store each QR code in memory (as a buffer or data URL).
  - [ ] Name each QR code file as `{participant_name}_{participant_id}.png` (sanitize names as needed).

- [ ] **Create ZIP Archive**
  - [ ] Initialize a new ZIP archive in memory.
  - [ ] Add each QR code image to the ZIP archive with the appropriate filename.
  - [ ] (Optional) Add a CSV file to the ZIP with participant info and URLs for reference.

- [ ] **Send ZIP File to User**
  - [ ] Set appropriate response headers for file download (`Content-Type: application/zip`, `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="qrcodes.zip"`).
  - [ ] Return the ZIP file as a downloadable response.

- [ ] **Handle Large Events (Scalability)**
  - [ ] Test memory usage for large numbers of participants.
  - [ ] If needed, implement batching or background processing for very large events.

- [ ] **Error Handling & Validation**
  - [ ] Handle errors in QR code generation (e.g., invalid data).
  - [ ] Handle errors in ZIP creation or file streaming.
  - [ ] Provide user feedback for any failures.

- [ ] **UI/UX Enhancements**
  - [ ] Show progress indicator or loading state during QR code generation and zipping.
  - [ ] Display success or error messages after download attempt.

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Test with various event sizes (small, medium, large).
  - [ ] Test with edge cases (special characters in names, missing data, etc.).
  - [ ] Test download on different browsers and devices.

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Document the API/server action for QR code generation.
  - [ ] Document the user flow for event organizers.
